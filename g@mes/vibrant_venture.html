  <h1> Vibrant Venture </h1>
  <p> Step 1: Download the g@me <a href="Vibrant_Venture.zip" target="_blank"> here.</a> </p>
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "Vibrant_Venture" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 4: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "Vibrant_Venture" folder, then double click the "Vibrant Venture" file. You're in! </p>
  <p> Tips: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> You can leave this g@me running in the background if you so choose (although it will use up a lot of battery). </li>
    <li> To close this g@me, you can either click "quit" on the main menu or just close the window. </li>
    <li> To find the g@me again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This game will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
    but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. </li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is just a demo, so there are only three levels. However, that should be enough content to last a while (especially if you
    go for 100%) </li>
