  <p> Step 1: Download the game <a href="SHRUBNAUT.zip"> here.</a> </p>
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "SHRUBNAUT" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 4: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "SHRUBNAUT" folder, then scroll all the way down to the bottom and double click the "SHRUBNAUTHTML5" file.</p>
