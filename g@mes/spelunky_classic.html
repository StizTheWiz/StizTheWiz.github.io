  <h1> Spelunky Classic </h1>
  <p> Step 1: Download the g@me <a href="Spelunky_Classic.zip"> here. </a> </p>
  <p> When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "Spelunky_Classic" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left-hand side. You could also right-click the folder, select copy, and paste it into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 4: Right-click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "Spelunky_Classic" folder, then double-click the file titled "Spelunky". </p>
  <p> Step 6: A pop up will appear trying to get you to install something. Click "skip this installation." </p>
  <p> Step 7: Once the game boots up, a short cutscene will play. When you click the screen, a Microsoft Store pop up will appear. Click away from it, and you
  are good to go. </p>
  <p> Tips: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>This g@me is quite easy to run in the background, as it is not full screen. It also (in my opinion) doesn't use too much battery,
    so feel free to leave it running.</li>
    <li>To close this g@me, you can press "esc", then press f10 (fn + num lk), or go up the rope that says "quit" on the main screen and then press "esc". </li>
    <li>To find the g@me again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This g@me will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
    but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. Your progress will (probably) be reset, however. </li>
