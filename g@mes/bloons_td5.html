  <h1> Bloons TD5 </h1>
  <p> Step 1: Download the g@me <a href="Bloons_TD5.zip"> here. </a> </p>
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "Bloons_TD5" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left-hand side. You could also right-click the folder, select copy, and paste it into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 4: Right-click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "Bloons_TD5" folder, then double-click the file titled "BTD5-Win". </p>
  <p> Tips: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can leave this g@me running in the background if you so choose (although it will use up a lot of battery).</li>
    <li>To close this g@me, just close the window. </li>
    <li>To find the g@me again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This g@me will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
    but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. Your progress will (probably) be reset, however. </li>
