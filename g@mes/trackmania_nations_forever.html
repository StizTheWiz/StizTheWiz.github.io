  <h1> TrackMania Nations Forever </h1>
  <p> Step 1: Download the g@me <a href="TrackMania_Nations_Forever.zip"> here.</a> </p>
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "TrackMania_Nations_Forever" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 4: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "TrackMania_Nations_Forever" folder, then double click the file "TmForever". </p>
  <p> Step 6: A pop-up about the microsoft store will pop up at least once. Simply click away from it. </p>
  <p> Step 7: Eventually, a different pop up will appear trying to get you to install something. Click "skip this installation." </p>
  <p> Step 8: When you first get in, you will need to click "Ok" to the message about the error. However, it may not respond to you pressing the button. 
  To fix this, simply leave (not close) the application and go back in. </p>
  <p> When it asks you whether you want to play online or offline, click offline. Then, select your profile. </p>
  <p> Tips: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To change your inputs from arrow keys to WASD, click Profile on the main menu, then click Inputs.</li>
    <li>This g@me uses an actually absurd amount of battery, so I do not recommend leaving it running in the background.</li>
    <li>To close this g@me, click "Quit" on the main menu. You can close the window, but it will take much longer.</li>
    <li>After closing the g@me, it may give you a pop-up about compatibility. If it does, click "close."
    <li>To find the g@me again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This game will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
    but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. You progress will (probably) be reset, however.</li>
