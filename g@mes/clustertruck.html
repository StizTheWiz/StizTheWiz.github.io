<h1> Clustertruck </h1>
<p> Step 1: Download the g@me <a href="https://fastupload.io/989200854518006c" target="_blank"> here.</a> </p>
<p> Step 2: When the tab opens, click "download." Ignore the random other tabs that will open, just keep pressing download until it works.</p>
<p> Step 3: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
<p> Step 4: Move the "Clustertruck" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
<p> Step 5: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
<p> Step 6: Double click the newly extracted "Clustertruck" folder, then double click the "Clustertruck" file. Select "Play!" when the pop-up appears. Click
away from any pop-ups about the Microsoft Store. </p>
<p> Tips: </p>
<ul>
<li>This g@me has the tendancy to not respond when booting it up. Generally if you don't do anything it will load, but you may need to close and re-open it
at times.</li>
<li>To close this g@me, simply click "Quit" in the main menu.</li>
<li>You can leave this g@me running in the background (although it will use up a lot of battery).</li>
<li>To find the g@me again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This g@me will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. Your progress will (probably) be reset, however.</li>
</ul>
