<h1> Home </h1>
<p> Welcome to the website! Here you can find my collection of games, software, and other stuff!</p>
<p> In order to do anything, you're going to need to download a VPN from the VPN page. Without one, nearly all my download links are blocked.
Not only will this allow you to browse the internet unrestricted, it will also allow you to download any of the games on the Games page. </p>
<p> I have included some instructions for each and every download. Be sure to follow them, as they'll help you not blow up your laptop. </p>
<p> Also, make sure to check the Announcements page frequently, as I'll list what I'm working on and new stuff I add there. </p>
