<h1> Home </h1>
<p> Welcome to the website! Here you can find my collection of games, software, and other stuff!</p>
<p> To access downloadable games, click the Games page, and to access web games (and basically anything on the internet), click the VPN page. </p>
<p> I have included some instructions for each and every download. Be sure to follow them, as they'll help you not blow up your laptop. </p>
<p> Also, make sure to check the Announcements page frequently, as I'll list what I'm working on and new stuff I add there. </p>
<p> P.S. If the links for certain games aren't working, download the Opera browser from the VPN page and try it there! </p>
