# Stiz Software
## Welcome to the website, the go-to place when you want more of my stuff but don't feel like interacting with me!
### Here you can find my entire collection of games, browsers, AIs, and other software that I have accumulated over time. Don't worry, they're all safe!
### To access downloadable games, select "Games".
### To access the Opera browser, select "VPN".
### To access xGPT (AI), Pynet (Chat Servers), or any other random stuff I might have, select "Other Tools".
### When downloading anything, I HIGHLY suggest checking for a README file that will contain instructions on how to properly use the software.
### If you have any questions, message me at _____!

### Special thanks to my friend who gave me a decent portion of this software. Check out some of his other stuff at https://theatomicneo.github.io/atomneo
### Also special thanks to all the other people I totally didn't steal this software from ;)




##### By downloading and using my software, you agree that I am in no way liable for any punishment you may face. While the district has no way to view your activity remotely, YOU ALONE are responsible if you are caught in class. Additionally, if you misuse any files and cause damage to your laptop (which is highly unlikely) I am not responsible in any way. Thank you, and enjoy!
