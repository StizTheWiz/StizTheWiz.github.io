<h1> VPN </h1>
<p> Okay, so this isn't <i> technically </i> a VPN, but it essentially does the same thing. Here you can download the Opera or Opera GX browser.
It has a built-in "VPN" that you can activate. It will allow you to access any blocked website, which allows you to play basically any online game you
can think of. The one downside is it will make Opera your default browser, so be prepared for something to open in Opera instead of Google.
<p> Step 1: Download the Opera browser <a href="OperaSetup.exe"> here.</a> If you want, you can download the Opera GX
browser instead. According to Opera, Opera GX is the "browser built specifically for gamers," whatever that means. If you're interested, you can
download it <a href="OperaGXSetup.exe"> here.</a> </p>
<p> Step 2: Follow the setup instructions. </p>
<p> Step 3: Now you can make an account, but it is only required if you plan to use built-in services like ChatGPT. Select VPN, and click the button.
When it turns blue (red on Opera GX), you are protected! You can now browse the internet unrestricted! </p>
<p> P.S. The browser may not work at home (it doesn't for me). Don't worry, the browser will always work in school. </p>
<p> My personal recommendations:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://netflix.com">Netflix</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://disneyplus.com">Disney+</a> </li>
<li>Literally any streaming service</li>
<li> <a href="https://coolmathgames.com">CoolMathGames</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://shsgames.github.io">SHSGames</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://neal.fun">Neal.fun</a> </li>
<li>Any other website you know of that has been blocked</li>
</ul>
