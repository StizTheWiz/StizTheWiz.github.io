<h1> VPN </h1>
<p> Okay, so the VPN page is a bit of a work in progress as I've been trying to find something that works ever since Opera stopped working. Currently, all
I have is SkyVPN, which is a little buggy but it generally works. Once I find some better options, I will add them here, so be sure to check often. </p>
<p> Step 0: This download requires administrator access. Go the the Home page and click Admin to get it. </p>
<p> Step 1: Download SkyVPN <a href="SkyVPNSetup-official.exe"> here.</a> </p>
<p> Step 2: When it asks if you want to make changes on your device, click yes. If you're on your school account, you will need to enter
ZCM-SystemName\AdminUsername in the username slot and your password. </p>
<p> Step 3: Follow the setup instructions. When it asks if you want it to open on start-up, I suggest choosing No, but it is your choice. </p>
<p> Step 4: You can now browse the internet unrestricted for 500 MB a day (unless you have premium). I know this isn't ideal, so I hope that I will be able
to find a VPN with no limits. If you find one, let me know! </p>
