<h1> Doom </h1>
<p> Step 1: Download the game <a href="Doom.zip">here.</a> </p>
<p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
<p> Step 3: Move the "Doom" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
the local disk button on the left-hand side. You could also right-click the folder, select copy, and paste it into the local disk. </p>
<p> Step 4: Right-click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
<p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "Doom" folder, then open the folder titled "prboom-server." </p>
<p> Step 6: Double-click the file titled "prboom." It should have a special icon to the left of it. Alternatively, you can double click the file
"glboom." It doesn't make much of a difference, though I have always felt like prboom runs better. </p>
<p> Step 7: Your computer will start to do some weird stuff. Just wait for it to finish and you'll be good to go! </p>
<p> Tips: </p>
<ul>
<li>When you boot up the game, press the escape button to view the menu, and use the arrow keys to cycle between the options.</li>
<li>After selecting a level and difficulty, use WASD to move, use your mouse/mousepad to look around, and left click to shoot (one finger click on mousepad).</li>
<li>Although you can leave the game running on your laptop while you do other things, I recommend you not.</li>
<li>To close the game, DO NOT JUST CLOSE THE WINDOW! Press the escape button, use the arrow keys to scroll down to "quit game", then
select press "y." Your computer will do some weird stuff again, and then you'll be back to whatever you were on before.</li>
<li>To find the game again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This game will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. Your progress will (probably) be reset, however.</li>
</ul>
