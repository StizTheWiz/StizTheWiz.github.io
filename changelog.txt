  - Added Announcement: Hey! It's been a while. But guess what! For an unspecified length of time, I will be offering the administrator access download for free!
                        You can access it by going to the Home page and clicking on Admin. I haven't decided how long it will be until I start charging (if I 
                        start charging), so I suggest getting it now before it is too late! I also added a few more games, so check those out if you want! Finally,
                        I am still searching for a better VPN, so if you know of one, feel free to reach out.

  - Added Announcement: Recently got administrator access on the school laptop, which is a big game changer. All other website related projects
                        I'm working on are going to be put on hold until I add the hack to get admin access for yourself. In the meantime, I've
                        added a new game, so be sure to check it out!

                        going to take much longer, so don't expect them anytime soon. One last thing, if you have any suggestions, questions, 
                        etc. regarding the site, feel free to reach out.
