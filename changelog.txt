  - Added Announcement: Recently got administrator access on the school laptop, which is a big game changer. All other website related projects
                        I'm working on are going to be put on hold until I add the hack to get admin access for yourself. In the meantime, I've
                        added a new game, so be sure to check it out!

  - Added Announcement: Finally got around to adding eight more games. I have a few more that I'll add eventually, but right now this is all 
                        I have planned. I'm working on getting some other stuff on here as well, including an AI and a chat network. Those are 
                        going to take much longer, so don't expect them anytime soon. One last thing, if you have any suggestions, questions, 
                        etc. regarding the site, feel free to reach out.
