  - Added Announcement: Once again it has been quite some time. At the beginning of this year the website got flagged and subsequently blocked. However, they have
                        underestimated my power. The website is now back up and running on the new URL. To prevent it from getting blocked again, I have gone in 
                        and censored certain words, primarily "g@me" and "V!P!N". In addition, I have added several new g@mes, as well as several previously promised 
                        programs. This is the biggest update since the site's launch, so unless it gets blocked again, this will be the last one for some time. If
                        there are any issues, please contact me, I have literally nothing better to do.

04/01/2024 - Minor Additions and Bug "Fixes"
  - Added Karlson 2D
  - Added tenretteB Install
  - Removed Admin page link
  - Added Announcement: It appears that for some bizzare reason the admin program only works properly when run from an external drive, which kinda means that all 
                        that time I spent implementing the admin download was for nothing. If you still want admin, contact me and I can give it to you directly 
                        from my USB.

  - Added Announcement: Hey! It's been a while. But guess what! For an unspecified length of time, I will be offering the administrator access download for free!
                        You can access it by going to the Home page and clicking on Admin. I haven't decided how long it will be until I start charging (if I 
                        start charging), so I suggest getting it now before it is too late! I also added a few more g@mes, so check those out if you want! Finally,
                        I am still searching for a better V!P!N, so if you know of one, feel free to reach out.

  - Added Website Icon
  - Added The Lair
  - Minor Improvements
  - Added Announcement: Recently got administrator access on the school laptop, which is a big game changer. All other website related projects
                        I'm working on are going to be put on hold until I add the hack to get admin access for yourself. In the meantime, I've
                        added a new g@me, so be sure to check it out!

  - Added Announcement: Finally got around to adding eight more g@mes. I have a few more that I'll add eventually, but right now this is all 
                        I have planned. I'm working on getting some other stuff on here as well, including an AI and a chat network. Those are 
                        going to take much longer, so don't expect them anytime soon. One last thing, if you have any suggestions, questions, 
                        etc. regarding the site, feel free to reach out.
