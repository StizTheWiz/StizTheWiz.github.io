  <p> 12/02/2024 - So I may or may not have gotten so bored in class that I completely redesigned the site. Whoops. In addition to the sight no longer looking
  hideous, I have also added a few more g@mes and fixed some download links. This is almost certainly it until at least the new year. I don't know how to end
  this one so bye. </p>
  <p> 10/02/2024 - Once again it has been quite some time. At the beginning of this year the website got flagged and subsequently blocked. However, they have
  underestimated my power. The website is now back up and running on the new URL. To prevent it from getting blocked again, I have gone in and censored certain
  words, primarily "g@me" and "V!P!N". In addition, I have added several new g@mes, as well as several previously promised programs. This is the biggest update 
  since the site's launch, so unless it gets blocked again, this will be the last one for some time. If there are any issues, please contact me, I have
  literally nothing better to do. </p>
  <p> 04/01/2024 - It appears that for some bizzare reason the admin program only works properly when run from an external drive, which kinda means that all 
  that time I spent implementing the admin download was for nothing. If you still want admin, contact me and I can give it to you directly from my USB. </p>
  <p> 03/26/2024 - Hey! It's been a while. But guess what! For an unspecified length of time, I will be offering the administrator access download for free!
  You can access it by going to the Home page and clicking on Admin. I haven't decided how long it will be until I start charging (if I start charging), so
  I suggest getting it now before it is too late! I also added a few more g@mes, so check those out if you want! Finally, I am still searching for a better
  V!P!N, so if you know of one, feel free to reach out. </p>
  <p> 01/04/2024 - Recently got administrator access on the school laptop, which is a big game changer. All other website related projects I'm working on 
  are going to be put on hold until I add the hack to get admin access for yourself. In the meantime, I've added a new g@me, so be sure to check it out!
  <p> 12/06/2023 - Finally got around to adding eight more g@mes. I have a few more that I'll add eventually, but right now this is all I have planned.
  I'm working on getting some other stuff on here as well, including an AI and a chat network. Those are going to take much longer, so don't expect them
  anytime soon. One last thing, if you have any suggestions, questions, etc. regarding the site, feel free to reach out. </p>
  <p> 11/27/2023 - Site has officially launched! You may notice that there aren't many g@mes right now. Believe me, there are more.
  I still have to add them, so I'll be doing that over the next week or two. Thanks for your patience. </p>
