<p> 03/26/2024 - Hey! It's been a while. But guess what! For an unspecified length of time, I will be offering the administrator access download for free!
You can access it by going to the Home page and clicking on Admin. I haven't decided how long it will be until I start charging (if I start charging), so
I suggest getting it now before it is too late! I also added a few more games, so check those out if you want! Finally, I am still searching for a better
VPN, so if you know of one, feel free to reach out. </p>
<p> 01/04/2024 - Recently got administrator access on the school laptop, which is a big game changer. All other website related projects I'm working on 
are going to be put on hold until I add the hack to get admin access for yourself. In the meantime, I've added a new game, so be sure to check it out!
<p> 12/06/2023 - Finally got around to adding eight more games. I have a few more that I'll add eventually, but right now this is all I have planned.
I'm working on getting some other stuff on here as well, including an AI and a chat network. Those are going to take much longer, so don't expect them
anytime soon. One last thing, if you have any suggestions, questions, etc. regarding the site, feel free to reach out. </p>
<p> 11/27/2023 - Site has officially launched! You may notice that there aren't many games right now. Believe me, there are more.
I still have to add them, so I'll be doing that over the next week or two. Thanks for your patience. </p>
