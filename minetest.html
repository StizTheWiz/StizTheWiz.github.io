<h1> Minetest </h1>
<p> Step 1: Download the game <a href="Minetest.zip"> here.</a> </p>
<p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
<p> Step 3: Move the "Minetest" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
<p> Step 4: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
<p> Step 5: Open the newly extracted "Minetest" folder, then double click the file titled "StartGame". </p>
<p> Step 6: Ignore the pop-up about the Microsoft Store and wait for it to load. If you want, you can try and mess with the world settings, but if you just
want to play, click Host Game. It will take a while to load, but eventually you will be put into the world.
<p> Tips: </p>
<ul>
<li>Although you can play this game without a mouse, it is 10000x easier with one.</li>
<li>This game is very laggy, so bear with it.</li>
<li>You can leave this game running in the background if you so choose (although it will use up a lot of battery).</li>
<li>To close this game, press the escape key while on the main menu.</li>
<li>To find the game again, select This PC on your desktop, then select Local Disk (C:). This game will NOT be removed by shutting down your laptop,
but will be removed if the laptop is reimaged. Your progress will (probably) be reset, however.</li>
</ul>
