  <h1> PyNet </h1>
  <p> This is a program that allows you to chat with others. Great for when you don't have access to phones. </p>
  <p> Step 1: Download PyNet <a href="PyNet.zip">here.</a> </p> 
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "PyNet" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 6: Open the newly extracted "PyNet" folder. At this point you will either want to host a server or connect to a server. Choose what you want
  by entering the number displayed for that item. Do not press 1 or 4, as these do not work.</p>
  <p> P.S. If you are hosting the server, you will need to run the program again and choose Connect to join. Do not close out of the hosting window. </p>
