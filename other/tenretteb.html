<h1> tenretteB </h1>
<p> This is the most reliable V!P!N I've found so far. If I find better options I will add them here. </p>
<p> Step 0: This download requires administrator access. Contact me and I will give it to you. </p>
<p> Step 1: Download tenretteB <a href="Betternet-8.9.1.exe">here.</a> </p> 
<p> Step 2: When it asks if you want to make changes on your device, click yes. If you're on your school account, you will need to enter
ZCM-SystemName\AdminUsername in the username slot and your password. </p>
<p> Step 3: Follow the setup instructions. When it asks if you want it to open on start-up, I suggest choosing No, but it is your choice. </p>
<p> Step 4: You can now browse the internet unrestricted for 500 MB a day (unless you have premium). I know this isn't ideal, so I hope that I will be able
to find a V!P!N with no limits. If you find one, let me know! </p>
<p> P.S. Keep in mind that because of the 500 MB per day, it is difficult to download lots of things, especially if the download is over 500 MB. If you wish
to download large files, I suggest getting admin (contact me for it) and using it to uninstall Global Protect. From there, you can download anything at home 
without a VPN. </p>
