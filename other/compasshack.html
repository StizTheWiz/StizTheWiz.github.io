  <h1> CompassHack </h1>
  <p> This is the Admin page. Here you will find the download for the files as well as detailed instructions on how to activate it, as well as troubleshooting
  methods if you experience difficulties. </p>
  <p> Okay, this is a rather long and detailed process, so be sure to pay close attention and follow every step accordingly. Once you're done, you will be able
  to install just about anything on your laptop (Steam, V!P!Ns, etc).
  <h3> How to Get Administrator Access </h3>
  <p> Step 0: This program will only work if it is run from a flash drive (USB). If you do not have one, contact me and I will give you admin personally.</p>
  <p> Step 1: Install the program <a href="CompassHack.zip">here.</a> </p>
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "CompassHack" zip file out of Downloads and into your flash drive. </p>
  <p> Step 4: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. (from this point on, a copy of the instructions is located in the CompassHack folder if
  you would prefer to view them there) </p>
  <p> Step 5: Save everything that you need to before continuing, as this will sign you out and close everything. Open the CompassHack folder, navigate to the
  CompassHackz folder, scroll down and double click the file "CompassPreLoader." If it has been over a minute and a half and nothing has happened, double
  click again. </p>
  <p> Step 6: When the prompt appears asking if you want to let "Compass.exe" make changes to your device, click yes. </p>
  <p> Step 7: BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE BACK TO THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE CONTINUING. Enter your student ID when prompted, then press "Y" and click enter. 
  This will sign you out. If prompted with messages of applications being open, select "sign out anyway." </p>
  <p> Step 8: Sign back in as normal </p>
  <p> Step 9: Navigate back to the CompassHack folder by clicking "This PC," on your desktop, then Local Disk (C:). </p>
  <p> Step 10: Double click the "AccountCreator" file, and click "yes" when the pop-up appears. </p>
  <p> Step 11: It will now ask for a username, then a password. Create a username and password that you will use for your administrator account. Make sure it is
  something that you will remember, and it must not have any spaces. </p>
  <p> Step 12: It will ask you to confirm that this is your username and password. Type "Y" and press enter. If the prompt says that two commands completed
  sucessfully, you are good to go. Close the command window. </p>
  <p> Step 13: In the bottom left corner, press the windows icon or the search bar and search for "System Information." </p>
  <p> Step 14: Open it, and look for the item "System Name." It should be a code of letters and numbers starting with "ZCM-". This code is important, so take
  a picture of it or write it down for later. </p>
  <p> Step 15: Click the windows icon in the bottom left corner, click the CCPS icon, and select "switch user." </p>
  <p> Step 16: It should show you the standard log in screen. In the username slot, type in the system name, followed by a backslash, followed by the username
  you created earlier in Steps 11-12 (example: ZCM-1234567890\YourUsername). It is very important that it is a backslash (\) and not a forward slash (/). Type in the password
  you created in the password slot, and press enter. </p>
  <p> Step 17: Click the windows icon or search bar and open Settings. Select Accounts, then Other Users on the left-hand side. Select your student account, then select "change account
  type". Switch it from Administrator to Standard User. </p>
  <p> Congratulations! You now have full administrator access on your laptop! The next section will show you how to do a few more things that will make your
  experience smoother, as well as troubleshooting. </p>
  <h3> How to Uninstall Global Protect </h3>
  <p> Step 1: On your admin account, click the windows icon or the search bar and type in "Settings". </p>
  <p> Step 2: On the settings page, select Apps, and scroll down until you see Global Protect. </p>
  <p> Step 3: Click it, then select Uninstall. If a pop-up about device changes appears, select "yes", and if prompted for a password, press "ok" without typing
  anything in. </p>
  <h3> How to Install Whatever You Want </h3>
  <p> Step 1: Search for the download of what you want on Google. If the website to get the download is blocked, install a V!P!N from the "Other" page on my site. </p>
  <p> Step 2: Once downloaded, double click the file. If you're on your admin account, you should simply need to click yes to the pop-up. If you are on your 
  school account, you will need to type in your SystemName\Username and your password for your admin account. If it prompts you for a username and password on
  your admin account, or if it gives you "The requested operation requires elevation" after typing in your username and password, see below. </p>
  <p> Tip: Certain applications, such as Steam, are blocked on the school wi-fi. To combat this, download it and / or log in at home or with a V!P!N. </p>
  <h3> How to Return to School Account </h3>
  <p> Click the windows icon, then the CCPS icon, and select your student account. If for some reason it's not there, select switch user and type in 
  your regular log in information. </p>
  <h3> How to Return to Admin Account </h3>
  <p> Click the windows icon, then the CCPS icon, and select your admin account. If it's not there, see below. </p>
  <h3> How to Return to Admin Account After Computer Shut Down </h3>
  <p> Repeat Steps 13 - 16. </p>
  <h3> Help! My Admin is no longer working! ("The requested operation requires elevation" error)</h3>
  <p> Step 0: Plug in your flash drive that you have the CompassHack folder stored on.</p>
  <p> Step 1: On your "admin" account, open This PC, then your flash drive, then the CompassHack folder. Open CompassHackz, then scroll down and double-click
  CompassPreLoader. </p>
  <p> Step 2: When asked if you want to make changes on your device, click yes. When asked for your student ID, DO NOT ENTER IT! Instead, enter your
  Admin user name. </p>
  <p> Step 3: You will be signed out. Log back into your admin account and you should be good to go. Make sure you have your system name so you can log
  back in. </p>
  <h3> Help! I don't remember the username I created! </h3>
  <p> Step 0: I can only help you recover your username, not your password. </p>
  <p> Step 1: Click the windows icon or the search bar and type in "Powershell". Make sure you type the full word, and select the one that says "run command,"
  not the one that says "App" or "Windows Powershell ISE". </p>
  <p> Step 2: Type in the command "Get-LocalUser" and press enter. </p>
  <p> Step 3: Several accounts (usernames) will appear. The one that does not have a description is yours. </p>
