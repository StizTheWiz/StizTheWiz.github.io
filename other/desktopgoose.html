  <h1> Desktop Goose </h1>
  <p> Funny goose lol </p>
  <p> Step 1: Download the program <a href=DesktopGoose.zip> here.</a> </p>
  <p> Step 2: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." </p>
  <p> Step 3: Move the "DesktopGoose" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
  the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
  <p> Step 5: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
  been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
  <p> Step 6: Open the newly extracted "DesktopGoose" folder, then double click the "GooseDesktop" file. Note that your computer may recognize the program
  as a virus (it kinda is, but it's not harmful)</p>
  <p> Tips: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> To close the application, press and hold "esc". </li>
    <li> I included a few mods that you can turn on if you so choose. Read some of the text files to learn how. You can also find other mods on the internet. </li>
    <li> You can also make other edits to the images and text that the goose drags out. I could tell you how, but I don't feel like it, so figure it out. </li>
    <li> This program serves literally no purpose so I'm not putting much effort on these instructions or tips. Sue me. </li>
  </ul>
