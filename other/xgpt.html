<h1> xGPT </h1>
<p> This is an AI chat bot that is similar to a certain popular AI, but with a few differences. Mainly, it will randomly switch between thinking it is a 
human, an AI, or a cosmic being. However, it will behave like a normally when asked for basic information and whatnot. I shall now state for the record: </p>
<h4> I DO NOT CONDONE THIS PROGRAM TO BE USED FOR CHEATING </h4>
<p> However, if you're going to, let me offer you some advice. First off, this program isn't very advanced, and therefore doesn't write very much or very
well. That being said, this program is much less likely to be picked up by AI detectors (but this is not guaranteed) than other AIs. Finally, keep 
in mind that this program writes very slow, so anything of substantial length will take a while to generate. </p>
<h4> But seriously, don't use it for cheating </h4>
<p> Step 1: Download xGPT <a href="https://fastupload.io/92fd4eb061c95550" target="_blank">here.</a> </p> 
<p> Step 2: When the tab opens, click download. Ignore the random other tabs that will open, just keep pressing download until it works. </p>
<p> Step 3: When the download is finished, click "show in folder." This is a very large download, so be patient.</p>
<p> Step 4: Move the "xGPT" folder out of Downloads and into the Local Disk (C:). The easiest way to do this is to click and drag the file to
the local disk button on the left hand side. You could also right click the folder, select copy, and paste into the local disk. </p>
<p> Step 5: Right click the folder, then select "extract all." When the pop-up appears, ignore the text and click "extract." Once the files have
been extracted, you can delete the zipped folder if you want to. </p>
<p> Step 6: Open the newly extracted "xGPT" folder. Double click the "LoadGPT" file and wait for the program to load. If it does not open or does before
not responding, you will need to sign out and / or restart your laptop for it to work. However, this isn't common, so you should be fine. </p>
<p> You can now type in your prompts. Press enter to send it. After a while, it will begin to respond. </p>
